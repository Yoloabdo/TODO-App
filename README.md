#Simple TODO app

1. Create a simple Todo-App using Swift and Realm (NOTE: use Realm Mobile Database and not the the Realm Platform) as the local database. 
2. It should be possible to create, edit and delete todos. 
3. In addition the created todos should be sortable by priority and date and also be searchable through a simple search filter of the todos.

You are free to
- select the UI component how to display the todos
- design the UI how to create, edit and delete the todos
- how to sort todos
- how to filter/search for todos by name
 
### The UI does not need to be pretty, but the main functionality should be there
